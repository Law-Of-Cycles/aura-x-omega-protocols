# Aura-X Omega Protocols

## Project Purpose and Overview
The Aura-X Omega Protocols project outlines a series of high-level instructions and guidelines for AI agents. Its core mission is to enable seamless, efficient, and transparent versioning and value creation under absolute control. Each protocol emphasizes clear execution, strategic decision-making, and maintaining a strong foundation for iterative collaboration.

## Version History and Differences
- **v1.0**: Initial structure and protocol description.
- **v2.0**: Added "无缝执行授权" for seamless execution and improved strategic directives.

## Usage Instructions
The protocols are designed to be used as a guiding document for AI task execution. They ensure that every step and decision is traceable and aligns with the strategic objectives outlined in the "to-do-list.md". Each step must be executed without delay once approved.

## Relevant Documentation
All procedural instructions and philosophical guidelines are contained within the protocols themselves, ensuring that AI agents execute tasks effectively while adhering to the core principles outlined.
